# Epic 6: Polish & Deployment

**Epic ID:** EPIC-006  
**Epic Name:** Polish & Deployment  
**Priority:** High (Final touches for production)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours  
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Epic Goal

Polish the portfolio website with final optimizations, add mobile responsiveness, implement remaining UX enhancements, and deploy to Vercel for production access.

---

## Epic Description

### Context

With all core features complete (Hero, Navigation, Content, Projects), this epic focuses on:
1. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Making the site usable on all devices
2. **Performance Optimization** - Ensuring fast load times
3. **Final Polish** - UI/UX refinements and bug fixes
4. **Deployment** - Going live on Vercel

Per MVP priorities, mobile was deferred to focus on desktop experience first. Now we optimize for all screen sizes.

### What This Epic Delivers

- ✅ Mobile-responsive layouts for all sections
- ✅ Performance optimizations (bundle size, images, animations)
- ✅ Cross-browser testing and fixes
- ✅ SEO meta tags and Open Graph setup
- ✅ Deployment to Vercel with custom domain (optional)
- ✅ Production-ready, live portfolio website

## Risk Assessment

### Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Mobile layout breaks | Medium | Medium | Test thoroughly on multiple devices |
| Performance regression | Low | Medium | Monitor Lighthouse scores, optimize proactively |
| Deployment failures | Low | High | Test build locally before deploying |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Test on all major browsers |

### Risk Mitigation Plan

1. **Mobile Issues:** Use Chrome DevTools device emulation, test on real devices
2. **Performance:** Run Lighthouse after each change, address issues immediately
3. **Deployment:** Test `npm run build` locally, verify static export works
4. **Browser Bugs:** Use Can I Use for feature support, implement fallbacks

---

## Technical Notes

### Mobile Navigation Decision

**Option 1:** Keep floating dots (may be small on mobile)  
**Option 2:** Add hamburger menu (more traditional)  
**Recommendation:** Keep floating dots if usable, otherwise add hamburger

### Performance Targets

- **Initial Load:** < 2s on 4G
- **FCP:** < 1.5s
- **LCP:** < 2.5s
- **TTI:** < 3s
