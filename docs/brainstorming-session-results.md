## Technique Sessions

### Question Storming - 10 minutes

**Description:** Generate questions instead of answers to explore all dimensions of the portfolio website challenge. This technique helps uncover assumptions and identify critical decision points before jumping to solutions.

#### Ideas Generated:

1. Should visitors first see my resume or my projects?
2. How should resume and projects be displayed?
3. Should the website be single-page scroll or multi-page navigation?
4. What technical framework should be used?
5. How should the overall page be laid out?
6. How much personal style and character should the design have?
7. What level of interactivity will attract recruiter attention?
8. What's the best method to describe each project?
9. What format for project display: links only, links + screenshots, or richer presentation?
10. How much detail should work experience show? How should it be described?

#### Insights Discovered:

- **Content Priority Uncertainty**: Initial confusion between leading with credentials vs. work samples revealed need for strategic information architecture
- **Presentation Depth Challenge**: Balance between providing enough information and overwhelming recruiters emerged as a critical theme
- **Technical Foundation Questions**: Framework and architecture decisions needed to be made before visual design

#### Notable Connections:

- All questions ultimately connected to the core audience: recruiters with limited time seeking quick assessment of capabilities
- Questions revealed a tension between showcasing personality and maintaining professional credibility

### Mind Mapping - 40 minutes

**Description:** Starting from the central concept (Personal Portfolio Website), we explored major branches (Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact) and developed detailed sub-ideas for each module.

#### Central Concept: Personal Portfolio Website

#### Branch 1: Hero Section (Homepage/Welcome Area)

**Key Decisions:**

- **Visual Concept**: "Code Aesthetics" - Terminal window on geometric code pattern background
- **Background**: Geometric code patterns (not Matrix rain, not editor style) with slow rotation/morphing
- **Center Element**: Terminal-style window displaying real tech stack in code format
- **Animation**: 5-second typewriter effect for tech stack display
- **Interaction**: "Run" button scrolls smoothly to About section
- **Name Placement**: Within terminal window as part of code (Option C selected)
- **Navigation**: Right-side floating dots with hover labels
- **Philosophy**: Minimal, no excess elements, no scroll-down arrow

**Content Format Selected:**

```javascript
const skills = {
  frontend: ['React', 'Next.js', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind'],
  backend: ['Node.js', 'Express', 'PostgreSQL'],
  tools: ['Git', 'Docker', 'AWS'],
};
```

**Design Rationale**: First impression must communicate developer identity while being visually striking and interactive.

---

#### Branch 2: About Me Section

**Key Decisions:**

- **Content Approach**: Value-driven statement (Option B)
- **Length**: 2-3 sentences maximum
- **Visual Layout**: Card-style design continuing terminal aesthetic
- **Photo**: No photo, pure text content
- **Animation**: Scroll entrance animation only

**Finalized Content:**

```
Creative problem solver with 6+ years of front-end development experience.
I specialize in transforming complex requirements into elegant, user-friendly
web applications. Proficient in React, Vue, and modern JavaScript ecosystem,
with a strong focus on performance optimization and clean code.
```

**Design Rationale**: Immediately communicate value proposition and expertise without requiring recruiters to read lengthy biography.

---

#### Branch 3: Skills Section

**Key Decisions:**

- **Categorization Method**: By type (Option A)
  - Frontend: React, Vue, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  - Backend: Node.js, Express
  - Tools & Others: Git, CMS management, SSR
- **Visual Style**: Card grid layout
- **Technology Display**: Icon + text labels (not progress bars, not tag cloud)
- **Interaction**: Static display with scroll entrance animations only

**Design Rationale**: Clear categorization helps recruiters quickly assess full-stack capabilities. Icon + text provides visual interest while remaining professional.

---

#### Branch 4: Experience Section

**Key Decisions:**

- **Detail Level**: Simplified version (Option B) - 1-2 key highlights per position
- **Visual Presentation**: Timeline layout showing career progression
- **Sort Order**: Newest first (2024 â†’ 2017)
- **Animation**: Entrance animation

**Work History to Display:**

1. Front End Engineer - Shanghai Jiufang Cloud (Nov 2020 - Apr 2024)
2. Front End Engineer - Shanghai YouBiHui Training School (Aug 2020 - Oct 2020)
3. Front End Engineer - Huizhong Business Consulting (May 2018 - Jun 2020)
4. Front End Developer - Qingdao Jiaoyin Information Technology (Oct 2017 - Aug 2018)

**Design Rationale**: Timeline visualization tells career story at a glance. Simplified highlights respect recruiter time while detailed resume PDF available for deeper review.

---

#### Branch 5: Projects Section (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Key Decisions:**

- **Layout**: 2-column card grid (desktop)
- **Visual Elements**: Project screenshot/concept image + name + description
- **Technology Display**: Tech stack with icons + text
- **Interaction**: Hover lift effect + reveal Live Demo/GitHub buttons
- **Screenshot Strategy**:
  - For live projects: Actual interface screenshots
  - For non-screenshotable projects: Concept diagrams

**Three Projects to Showcase:**

1. **ChatGPT Timeline Navigator**
   - Type: Browser extension/tool
   - Status: Not deployed online
   - Display: Concept diagram (to be created)
   - Links: GitHub only

2. **Real-time Collaboration Platform**
   - Type: Web application (whiteboard + document collaboration)
   - Status: Deployed and live
   - Display: Interface screenshots
   - Links: Live Demo + GitHub

3. **MEME Alchemist**
   - Type: Web application (MEME fetching + facts â†’ image generation)
   - Status: Deployed and live
   - Display: Interface screenshots
   - Links: Live Demo + GitHub

**Content Template for Each Project:**

- Project name
- One-sentence description
- Technology stack list with icons

**Design Rationale**: This is the core of the portfolio - where recruiters assess actual capabilities. 2-column layout provides good balance between showcase size and comparison ability. Hover interactions reveal actions without cluttering initial view.

---

#### Branch 6: Contact Information

**Key Decisions:**

- **Location**: Fixed top navigation bar, upper right corner (Option A)
- **Content**: Email + LinkedIn + GitHub icons
- **Visibility**: Always visible as header element
- **No Separate Section**: Contact is utility, not destination

**Design Rationale**: Recruiters should be able to contact you from anywhere on the page without scrolling. Icons in header achieve this while maintaining clean design.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts - Removed from Scope_

Note: User decided to remove all "future enhancement" features from consideration to focus on core MVP experience.

Previously considered but descoped:

- Dark mode toggle
- Complex page transition animations
- Downloadable PDF resume with dynamic generation
- Visitor analytics/tracking
- Blog/articles section
- More elaborate 3D effects or WebGL experiences

**Rationale for Descoping**: Focus resources on perfecting core experience rather than adding peripheral features. These can be considered after initial launch and recruiter feedback.

---

### Insights & Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

- **Desktop-First is Strategic**: For portfolio targeting recruiters, desktop experience should be prioritized as most hiring managers review candidates on workstations. Mobile can be a secondary iteration.

- **Animation as Identity, Not Decoration**: Interactive elements (geometric code background, typewriter effect, hover animations) aren't just visual polishâ€”they demonstrate technical capability and attention to detail.

- **Simplicity Respects Recruiter Time**: 2-3 sentence descriptions and 1-2 highlights per job show consideration for busy hiring managers while still providing substantive information.

- **Code Aesthetic Reinforces Brand**: The terminal window and code-based visual language immediately communicate "developer" identity without requiring text explanation.

- **Single-Page + Anchors = Best of Both Worlds**: Smooth scrolling provides narrative flow while anchor links enable direct sharing ("check out my projects: site.com/#projects").

- **Projects are the Proof**: Among all sections, the Projects showcase is most criticalâ€”it's the tangible evidence of capabilities. Investing time in quality screenshots and clear presentation here has highest ROI.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Project Initialization + Basic Architecture

**Rationale:**
Establishes foundation for all subsequent work. Next.js setup, routing configuration, and scroll system are prerequisites for implementing any features. Getting this right early prevents costly refactoring later.

**Next steps:**

1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up project structure (components, sections, utils)
3. Configure Tailwind CSS or chosen styling solution
4. Implement basic single-page scroll with smooth scrolling
5. Set up anchor link routing (/#about, /#projects, etc.)
6. Create placeholder sections for all modules
7. Set up Git repository and initial commit

**Resources needed:**

- Next.js 14+ documentation
- React knowledge
- Tailwind CSS (or styled-components/CSS modules)
- Git/GitHub

**Timeline:**
2-4 hours for experienced developer, possibly 6-8 hours if learning Next.js simultaneously

---

#### #2 Priority: Hero Section Implementation

**Rationale:**
The hero section is the first impression and the most technically complex feature. It combines geometric code background animation and terminal window with typewriter effect. Tackling this early establishes the visual language for the entire site and provides a sense of accomplishment that motivates continued development.

**Next steps:**

1. Research and select animation library (Canvas API, Three.js, or React Three Fiber)
2. Implement geometric code pattern background with animation
3. Design and code terminal window component
4. Implement typewriter effect for tech stack display
5. Add "Run" button with smooth scroll to About section
6. Ensure performance is acceptable (60fps target)
7. Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

**Resources needed:**

- Animation library documentation (Three.js recommended for geometric patterns)
- Typewriter library or custom implementation
- Performance profiling tools (Chrome DevTools)
- Terminal/code aesthetic references

**Timeline:**
12-18 hours total:

- Geometric background: 8-12 hours
- Terminal window + typewriter: 4-6 hours

**Note:** This is the most time-intensive single feature but also highest impact.

---

#### #3 Priority: Content Filling + Basic Styling

**Rationale:**
With architecture and hero section complete, implementing remaining sections (About, Skills, Experience, Projects) establishes the complete content flow. Basic styling ensures visual consistency and allows for early user testing and feedback gathering.

**Next steps:**

1. Implement About section with card layout
2. Create Skills section with categorized card grid
3. Build Experience section with timeline visualization
4. Develop Projects section with 2-column card grid (using placeholders)
5. Implement scroll entrance animations for all sections
6. Add project card hover effects
7. Ensure consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
8. Add floating navigation dots with labels
9. Add header with contact icons (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub)

**Resources needed:**

- Framer Motion or alternative animation library
- Finalized content text (About description, skills list, experience highlights)
- Placeholder images for projects (can use colored gradients or stock images)
- Icon library (React Icons or similar)

**Timeline:**
10-15 hours:

- About section: 2-3 hours
- Skills section: 3-4 hours
- Experience section: 3-4 hours
- Projects section: 4-6 hours
- Navigation and header: 2-3 hours

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- **Structured questioning approach**: Starting with Question Storming helped uncover core decisions before diving into solutions
- **Iterative decision-making**: Breaking down the website into branches (sections) made complex design manageable
- **Clear option presentation**: Providing 2-4 concrete options for each decision point enabled quick, confident choices
- **Priority clarification**: Explicitly categorizing features into MVP vs. future helped maintain focus
- **User-driven decisions**: Facilitating rather than prescribing allowed authentic design choices aligned with user's vision

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **Color palette definition**: Specific color codes, gradients, and theme colors not yet determined
- **Typography choices**: Font families for headings, body text, and code not selected
- **Specific animation parameters**: Easing functions, duration timings, and animation choreography need refinement
- **Detailed project descriptions**: One-sentence descriptions for each project need to be written
- **Work experience highlights**: 1-2 key highlights per job position need to be selected from resume
- **Technology stack icons**: Specific icon library and styling consistency needs definition
- **Performance budgets**: Load time targets and animation performance thresholds not established

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Moodboarding**: Collect visual references for code aesthetics, geometric patterns, and terminal designs to guide implementation
- **Prototyping**: Consider creating a quick Figma or CodePen prototype of the hero section before full implementation
- **Five Whys**: When making design decisions during implementation, ask "why" to ensure alignment with core goal (impressing recruiters)
- **A/B concept testing**: Once deployed, could create variations of hero section or project layout to test with sample audience

### Questions That Emerged

- How will the geometric code background balance visual interest with readability?
- What specific technologies/libraries will best achieve the terminal window and typewriter effect?
- Should the "Run" button have a specific call-to-action text, or remain as "Run"?
- How will project card hover states balance between subtle and eye-catching?
- What metrics will define "success" for this portfolio? (recruiter contact rate, interview requests, etc.)
- Should there be any micro-interactions beyond the major animations identified?
- How will code snippets in the terminal handle syntax highlighting while maintaining readability?

### Next Session Planning

**Suggested topics:**

- Design system definition (colors, typography, spacing system)
- Detailed component wireframing (if needed before coding)
- Content writing workshop (finalize all copy)
- Project screenshot/concept diagram creation session

**Recommended timeframe:**
Before beginning implementation or during early development to refine visual details

**Preparation needed:**

- Review Next.js documentation and animation library tutorials
- Gather visual inspiration for code aesthetics and developer portfolios
- Draft specific text for About section and project descriptions
- Set up development environment and tools
